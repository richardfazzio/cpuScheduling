# cpuScheduling
This is a program simulatates cpu scheduling with first-come-first-serve (FCFS), shortest-job-first (SJF), and multi-level-feedback-queue (MLFQ) implemented using C++. The simulation takes a vector of a vector of ints that represents a number of processes, with the ints being the CPU times and I/O times. Then the program will calculates the waiting time, turn around time, and response time for each process for the given algorithm. Also, the program calculates the total average turnaround/wait/response time for each corresponding algorithm as well as the cpu utilization.
